# Gallery-and-Lightbox
In this project, I created an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and jQuery. At the top of the page, there is a search area where photos will hide and show depending on user input. When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo will display in a lightbox. Back and previous arrows allow the user to cycle through photos.
